Hello! My name is Phil, and I am a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics at Stony Brook University. My research is currently focused on the use of multimodal neuroimaging to investigate functional and behavioral abnormalities in people with schizophrenia. Particularly, I have primarily focused on the implementation of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to the investigation of neural correlates of working memory impairment. As fMRI is an inherently noisy imaging technique, I am also interested in the developing of denoising techniques to improve the reproducibility of findings across the neuroimaging field.

Upon graduation, I plan to attend a CAMPEP Accredited Medical Physics residency program. I aspire to become a physicist and researcher that focuses on the translation of novel biomedical imaging methods into the clinical setting.

In my free time, I am an avid saltwater fisherman, hiker, photographer, and musician.
