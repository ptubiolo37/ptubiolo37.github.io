  abstract={In studying the neural correlates of working memory (WM) ability via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in health and disease, it is relatively uncommon for investigators to report associations between brain activation and measures of task performance. Additionally, how the choice of WM task impacts observed activation–performance relationships is poorly understood. We sought to illustrate the impact of WM task on brain–behavior correlations using two large, publicly available datasets. We conducted between-participants analyses of task-based fMRI data from two publicly available datasets: The Human Connectome Project (HCP; n = 866) and the Queensland Twin Imaging (QTIM) Study (n = 459). Participants performed two distinct variations of the n-back WM task with different stimuli, timings, and response paradigms. Associations between brain activation ([2-back − 0-back] contrast) and task performance (2-back % correct) were investigated separately in each dataset, as well as across datasets, within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), medial prefrontal cortex, and whole cortex. Global patterns of activation to task were similar in both datasets. However, opposite associations between activation and task performance were observed in bilateral pre-supplementary motor area and left middle frontal gyrus. Within the dlPFC, HCP participants exhibited a significantly greater activation–performance relationship in bilateral middle frontal gyrus relative to QTIM Study participants. The observation of diverging activation–performance relationships between two large datasets performing variations of the n-back task serves as a critical reminder for investigators to exercise caution when selecting WM tasks and interpreting neural activation in response to a WM task.}

  title={Characterization and Mitigation of a Simultaneous Multi-Slice fMRI Artifact: Multiband Artifact Regression in Simultaneous Slices},
  author={Philip N. Tubiolo and John C. Williams and Jared X. Van Snellenberg},
  abstract={Simultaneous multi-slice (multiband) acceleration in fMRI has become widespread, but may be affected by novel forms of signal artifact. Here, we demonstrate a previously unreported artifact manifesting as a shared signal between simultaneously acquired slices in all resting-state and task-based multiband fMRI datasets we investigated, including publicly available consortium data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We propose Multiband Artifact Regression in Simultaneous Slices (MARSS), a regression-based detection and correction technique that successfully mitigates this shared signal in unprocessed data. We demonstrate that the signal isolated by MARSS correction is likely nonneural, appearing stronger in neurovasculature than gray matter. Additionally, we evaluate MARSS both against and in tandem with sICA+FIX denoising, which is implemented in HCP resting-state data, to show that MARSS mitigates residual artifact signal that is not modeled by sICA+FIX. MARSS correction leads to study-wide increases in signal-to-noise ratio, decreases in cortical coefficient of variation, and mitigation of systematic artefactual spatial patterns in participant-level task betas. Finally, MARSS correction has substantive effects on second-level t-statistics in analyses of task-evoked activation. We recommend that investigators apply MARSS to multiband fMRI datasets with moderate or higher acceleration factors, in combination with established denoising methods.},

  abstract={Simultaneous multi-slice (multiband) accelerated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides dramatically improved temporal and spatial resolution for resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) studies of the human brain in health and disease. However, multiband acceleration also poses unique challenges for denoising of subject motion induced data artifacts, the presence of which is a major confound in RSFC research that substantively diminishes reliability and reproducibility. We comprehensively evaluated existing and novel approaches to volume censoring-based motion denoising in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. We show that assumptions underlying common metrics for evaluating motion denoising pipelines, especially those based on quality control-functional connectivity (QC-FC) correlations and differences between high- and low-motion participants, are problematic, and appear to be inappropriate in their current widespread use as indicators of comparative pipeline performance and as targets for investigators to use when tuning pipelines for their own datasets. We further develop two new quantitative metrics that are instead agnostic to QC-FC correlations and other measures that rely upon the null assumption that no true relationships exist between trait measures of subject motion and functional connectivity, and demonstrate their use as benchmarks for comparing volume censoring methods. Finally, we develop and validate quantitative methods for determining dataset-specific optimal volume censoring parameters prior to the final analysis of a dataset, and provide straightforward recommendations and code for all investigators to apply this optimized approach to their own RSFC datasets.}

  abstract={Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the auditory and visual sensory systems of the human brain is an active area of investigation in the study of human health and disease. The medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are key thalamic nuclei involved in the processing and relay of auditory and visual information, respectively, and are the subject of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI studies of neural activation and functional connectivity in human participants. However, localization of BOLD fMRI signal originating from neural activity in MGN and LGN remains a technical challenge, due, in part, to the poor definition of boundaries of these thalamic nuclei in standard T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Here, we report the development and evaluation of an auditory and visual sensory thalamic localizer (TL) fMRI task that produces participant-specific functionally-defined regions of interest (fROIs) of both MGN and LGN, using 3 Tesla multiband fMRI and a clustered-sparse temporal acquisition sequence, in less than 16 minutes of scan time. We demonstrate the use of MGN and LGN fROIs obtained from the TL fMRI task in standard resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) fMRI analyses in the same participants. In RSFC analyses, we validated the specificity of MGN and LGN fROIs for signals obtained from primary auditory and visual cortex, respectively, and benchmarked their performance against alternative atlas- and segmentation-based localization methods. The TL fMRI task and analysis code (written in Presentation and MATLAB, respectively) have been made freely available to the wider research community.}

  abstract={Working memory (WM) is an essential system of cognitive processes for a wide range of cognitive activities and is associated with diverse real-world outcomes. Despite extensive research in cognitive psychology, the complex multifaceted nature of WM is often overlooked in applied settings such as clinical and neuroimaging research. This study aims to investigate the latent structure of WM by examining a comprehensive set of WM tasks commonly used in both theoretical and applied research in cognitive psychology and psychiatric neuroimaging. A large sample of healthy young adults (N = 608) completed a battery of WM tasks and other cognitive measures. Factor analyses and structural equation models revealed a three-factor structure: Storage, Executive Attention, and Updating. These factors were moderately correlated but contributed uniquely to explaining variance in intelligence measures. Furthermore, when the three factors were considered in a single model, only the Updating and Executive Attention factors had unique shared variance with intelligence. The findings support that WM is a multifaceted construct, with complex span and n-back tasks capturing important and distinct components related to real-world cognitive performance. This highlights the need for precise selection of measurement tools for WM in both theoretical and applied research contexts.}

  abstract={Background: Converging evidence from clinical neuroimaging and animal models has strongly implicated dysfunction of thalamocortical circuits in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Preclinical models of genetic risk for schizophrenia have shown reduced synaptic transmission from auditory thalamus to primary auditory cortex, which may represent a correlate of auditory disturbances such as hallucinations. Human neuroimaging studies, however, have found a generalized increase in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) between whole thalamus and sensorimotor cortex in people with schizophrenia (PSZ). We aimed to more directly translate preclinical findings by specifically localizing auditory and visual thalamic nuclei in unmedicated PSZ and measuring RSFC to primary sensory cortices.

Methods: In this case-control study, 82 unmedicated PSZ and 55 matched healthy controls (HC) completed RSFC functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Auditory and visual thalamic nuclei were localized for 55 unmedicated PSZ and 46 HC who additionally completed a sensory thalamic nuclei localizer fMRI task (N = 101). Using localized nuclei as RSFC seeds we assessed group differences in auditory and visual thalamocortical connectivity and associations with positive symptom severity.

Results: Auditory thalamocortical connectivity was not significantly different between PSZ and HC, but hyperconnectivity was associated with greater positive symptom severity in bilateral superior temporal gyrus. Visual thalamocortical connectivity was significantly greater in PSZ relative to HC in secondary and higher-order visual cortex, but not predictive of positive symptom severity.

Conclusion: These results indicate that visual thalamocortical hyperconnectivity is a generalized marker of schizophrenia, while hyperconnectivity in auditory thalamocortical circuits relates more specifically to positive symptom severity.}

  abstract={Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is marked by working memory (WM) deficits, which predict poor functional outcome. While most functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of WM in SCZ have focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), some recent work suggests that the medial PFC (mPFC) may play a role. We investigated whether task-evoked mPFC deactivation is associated with WM performance and whether it mediates deficits in SCZ. In addition, we investigated associations between mPFC deactivation and cortical dopamine release.
Methods: Patients with SCZ (n = 41) and healthy control participants (HCs) (n = 40) performed a visual object n-back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Dopamine release capacity in mPFC was quantified with [11C]FLB457 in a subset of participants (9 SCZ, 14 HCs) using an amphetamine challenge. Correlations between task-evoked deactivation and performance were assessed in mPFC and dorsolateral PFC masks and were further examined for relationships with diagnosis and dopamine release.
Results: mPFC deactivation was associated with WM task performance, but dorsolateral PFC activation was not. Deactivation in the mPFC was reduced in patients with SCZ relative to HCs and mediated the relationship between diagnosis and WM performance. In addition, mPFC deactivation was significantly and inversely associated with dopamine release capacity across groups and in HCs alone, but not in patients.
Conclusions: Reduced WM task-evoked mPFC deactivation is a mediator of, and potential substrate for, WM impairment in SCZ, although our study design does not rule out the possibility that these findings could relate to cognition in general rather than WM specifically. We further present preliminary evidence of an inverse association between deactivation during WM tasks and dopamine release capacity in the mPFC.}
