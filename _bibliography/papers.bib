  abstract={In studying the neural correlates of working memory (WM) ability via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in health and disease, it is relatively uncommon for investigators to report associations between brain activation and measures of task performance. Additionally, how the choice of WM task impacts observed activation–performance relationships is poorly understood. We sought to illustrate the impact of WM task on brain–behavior correlations using two large, publicly available datasets. We conducted between-participants analyses of task-based fMRI data from two publicly available datasets: The Human Connectome Project (HCP; n = 866) and the Queensland Twin Imaging (QTIM) Study (n = 459). Participants performed two distinct variations of the n-back WM task with different stimuli, timings, and response paradigms. Associations between brain activation ([2-back − 0-back] contrast) and task performance (2-back % correct) were investigated separately in each dataset, as well as across datasets, within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), medial prefrontal cortex, and whole cortex. Global patterns of activation to task were similar in both datasets. However, opposite associations between activation and task performance were observed in bilateral pre-supplementary motor area and left middle frontal gyrus. Within the dlPFC, HCP participants exhibited a significantly greater activation–performance relationship in bilateral middle frontal gyrus relative to QTIM Study participants. The observation of diverging activation–performance relationships between two large datasets performing variations of the n-back task serves as a critical reminder for investigators to exercise caution when selecting WM tasks and interpreting neural activation in response to a WM task.}

  title={Characterization and Mitigation of a Simultaneous Multi-Slice fMRI Artifact: Multiband Artifact Regression in Simultaneous Slices},
  author={Philip N. Tubiolo and John C. Williams and Jared X. Van Snellenberg},
  abstract={Simultaneous multi-slice (multiband) acceleration in fMRI has become widespread, but may be affected by novel forms of signal artifact. Here, we demonstrate a previously unreported artifact manifesting as a shared signal between simultaneously acquired slices in all resting-state and task-based multiband fMRI datasets we investigated, including publicly available consortium data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We propose Multiband Artifact Regression in Simultaneous Slices (MARSS), a regression-based detection and correction technique that successfully mitigates this shared signal in unprocessed data. We demonstrate that the signal isolated by MARSS correction is likely nonneural, appearing stronger in neurovasculature than gray matter. Additionally, we evaluate MARSS both against and in tandem with sICA+FIX denoising, which is implemented in HCP resting-state data, to show that MARSS mitigates residual artifact signal that is not modeled by sICA+FIX. MARSS correction leads to study-wide increases in signal-to-noise ratio, decreases in cortical coefficient of variation, and mitigation of systematic artefactual spatial patterns in participant-level task betas. Finally, MARSS correction has substantive effects on second-level t-statistics in analyses of task-evoked activation. We recommend that investigators apply MARSS to multiband fMRI datasets with moderate or higher acceleration factors, in combination with established denoising methods.},
